Q2. For the CustomerId = 1060 (CustomerName = 'Anand Mudaliyar')
Identify the first InvoiceLine of his first Invoice, where "first" means the lowest respective IDs, and write an update query increasing the UnitPrice of this InvoiceLine by 20.

A re-run of the query in Q1 gives the resultset in Q2-Resultset_Corrected.csv (corrected on 15th April 2018 - Summed values in columns OrdersTotalValue & InvoicesTotalValue were incorrect) .

If you haven't managed to answer Q1, add the following selection query to the previous update query: CustomerId, CustomerName, InvoiceTotal.
The latter is the sum of all invoice lines for the target invoice.
The target InvoiceID is purposefully not shown, but the resultset post-update is given in Q2-Alternative-Resultset.csv
